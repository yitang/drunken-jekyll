## Drunken Jekyll

A Jekyll blog starter kit using the Sass libraries [Bourbon, Neat, Bitters, & Refills].

It also includes Mathjax pre-enabled, and a few other essentials like a Tags page.

This is intended as a personal default for myself, but if you want to use it, it IS gh-pages compatible (no plugins). 

Work in progress.
